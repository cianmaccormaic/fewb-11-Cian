    <h1>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>200g Spaghetti</li>
            <li>4 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (optional)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions (usually 8-10 minutes).</li>
            <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the sliced garlic to the skillet and saut√© until golden brown, being careful not to burn it (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li>Stir in the red pepper flakes and cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Once the pasta is cooked, reserve 1/2 cup of pasta water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Add the drained pasta to the skillet with the garlic and oil. Toss well to coat the pasta in the garlic oil mixture. If the pasta looks dry, add some of the reserved pasta water to create a silky sauce.</li>
            <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Garnish with fresh parsley (optional) and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
