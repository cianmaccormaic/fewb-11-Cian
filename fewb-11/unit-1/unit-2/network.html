    <h1>Common Network Protocols</h1>

    <p>
      Below is a list of three commonly used network protocols along with their
      descriptions:
    </p>

    <dl>
      <dt>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</dt>
      <dd>
        TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that ensures reliable data
        transmission between devices over a network.
      </dd>

      <dt>User Datagram Protocol (UDP)</dt>
      <dd>
        UDP is a connectionless protocol that allows fast transmission of data
        but does not guarantee delivery or error checking.
      </dd>

      <dt>Internet Protocol (IP)</dt>
      <dd>
        IP is responsible for routing and addressing packets of data so they can
        travel across networks to their destination.
      </dd>
    </dl>
